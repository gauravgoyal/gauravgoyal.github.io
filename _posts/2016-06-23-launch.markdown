Here we go.. my long awaited DNS finally got engaged with an IP.

## What's this?
Umm.. Anecdotes :)

## How it happened?
Well, I was sitting idle from past few days and surfing through web in search of some interesting tasks. Suddenly, a thought crossed my mind that I purchased a domain few months back. Why not build it, and this is how it happened.

Well, this is for now. I had some wonderful time creating this site, and learnt about few new things. I'll share them in my next post.

Till then bbye :)
